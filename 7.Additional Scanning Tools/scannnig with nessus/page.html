<title>Scannnig with Nessus</title>
</head><body>its a vulnerability scanner<br/>
good for external assessment <br/>
like this could be the first thing u would do 'as this takes time to be done<br/>
also used for internal assessment<br/>
installed nessus for ubuntu 64 bit<br/>
<br/>
went ot downloads folder<br/>
<img src="image.png" /><br/>
dpkg means depackaging<br/>
go to https://kali:8834/<br/>
and then register nessus<br/>
<br/>
we get free version through which can scan all private ports and upto 16 at a time<br/>
here 's what we get :<br/>
cant scan an external site or website <br/>
go in new scan and click on basic scan <br/>
<img src="image 2.png" width="510" height="350" /><br/>
in discovery change this <br/>
<img src="image 3.png" /><br/>
<br/>
in assessment go to<br/>
<img src="image 4.png" /><br/>
<br/>
launch this scan and then<br/>
go to new scan <br/>
go to advanced scan <br/>
just see the contents:<br/>
meanswhile pehle ke scan aisa aaya <br/>
<img src="image 5.png" width="850" height="308" /><br/>
finally we get this<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
<br/>
thus can add below stuff in notes:<br/>
<img src="image 7.png" /><br/>
installled version uis outdated na hence can contain vulnerabilties<br/>
<br/>
one more we got :<br/>
<img src="image 8.png" /><br/>
thus u could perfirm an overflow on it too<br/>
<br/>
now &nbsp;we got so many vulnerabilities :<br/>
if u dont get severe type of the then even report the medium and low ones too<br/>
go to export and then download nessus file and give to client<br/>
<br/>
bt never trust these vulnerabilities scannner like go and actuallly check ki jo versions they say and samajh<br/>
we wouldnt provide an ss of nessus ka output we would actually go and checkk &nbsp; <br/>
and prove ki that vulnerability is there <br/>
and prove ki they are out &nbsp;of date<br/>
<br/>
thus its gud to have a vulnerability scannner which gives u all the vunerabilities<br/>
just an extralayer of vulnerability tester <br/>
<br/>
now we ll start main stuff<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
