<title>4.Grabbing dtaa with Invoke-Bloodhound</title>
</head><body>1.invoke bloodhound fromm powershell<br/>
2.sharphound <br/>
3.python tool too<br/>
would use the first one <br/>
<br/>
are actually using sharpHound hi like<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image.png" /><br/>
went here and donwloaded it on the puniseher logged in as Frank Castle<br/>
<br/>
get the other windows machine running too<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
<br/>
before this we ran . .\ShellHound.ps1<br/>
now copy this file1.zip to kali somehow<br/>
now import this file to your kali<br/>
<br/>
thus imported it now<br/>
<img src="image 3.png" /><br/>
<br/>
import it in bloodhound<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 4.png" /><br/>
<br/>
to find the domain admins<br/>
<img src="image 5.png" /><br/>
<br/>
sqlservice<br/>
tony stark<br/>
marvel.adminstrato<br/>
all these are domain admins<br/>
for shortest path:<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 7.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;bootom left green is fcastle which is admin to red one which is tghe punisher.marvel.local which has session on Adminstrator@marvel.local which in turn is a member of domain admin@marvel.lcal<br/>
the final one basically<br/>
SO token impersonation<br/>
u want to target machines where domain admin is logged in <br/>
so thats the &nbsp;shortest path<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for shortest path from kerberostable users<br/>
<img src="image 8.png" /><br/>
<br/>
select lets say sql service<br/>
<img src="image 9.png" /><br/>
thus sql service is connceted to domain admin and to whihc spiderman as well as punisher has access too<br/>
below is shortest path to high value targets<br/>
<img src="image 10.png" /><br/>
<br/>
so thus its just 9users and 3 comouters so its damn complex bt graph helps us <br/>
THE PRE-BUILT ANALYTICS QUERIES are more than enough even though u can write ur own too<br/>
<br/>
enumeration is very very important for pentester ke liye<br/>
now post exploitation attacks once we have compromised one account how can we leverage that and get access to full netwroks and stuff<br/>
<br/>
