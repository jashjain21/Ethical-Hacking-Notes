<img src="image.png" /><br/>
inside marvel.local we have a bunch of different orgainistational units(ou's)<br/>
right cick on it click new-organisational unit <br/>
name it as Groups<br/>
take all such groups<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
<br/>
out of users accounts and <br/>
<br/>
just keep Guest and Adminsitrator in here <br/>
we saw properties of adminsitrator<br/>
<img src="image 3.png" /><br/>
<br/>
Domain users is someone who can login to the domain <br/>
so we ll crweate couple of domain users and admins to get an idea hiw they look like<br/>
<img src="image 4.png" /><br/>
<br/>
set poassword as Password1<br/>
and click on password never explires<br/>
right click on administrator and click copy to create new user called Tony Stark<br/>
<br/>
his password:password2019!@$<br/>
<br/>
new normal user :Peter Parker<br/>
password:Password2<br/>
<br/>
now make a fake sql service acc as domain adminsitrator<br/>
they should not be domain administrator acc ever bt probably 70 percent of times its like this only &nbsp;and we can then attack them <br/>
<img src="image 5.png" /><br/>
no space in USer logon name<br/>
<br/>
passeord:MYpassword123$<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
many people put such password in their descriptipon<br/>
coz they think only they can read them <br/>
<img src="image 7.png" /><br/>
<br/>
Click on New Share now<br/>
then smb share quick <br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 8.png" /><br/>
<br/>
then hit next<br/>
<img src="image 9.png" /><br/>
<br/>
finally thid is what we get<br/>
most domain controllers have file share <br/>
and we wnated to open up 139 and 445 so that smb is enabled on our domain controller so that we can attack them <br/>
<br/>
now we will create a spn(service principal name)<br/>
we are setting upl an attakc for kerbersoting <br/>
that is an attack that attacks servoces <br/>
so here we wanna attack sql service so we are setting up a spn<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 10.png" /><br/>
<br/>
now to make sure it is set <br/>
<img src="image 11.png" /><br/>
entered the command and we can see sqlservice has been set <br/>
run group policy managemnt as administrator<br/>
<img src="image 12.png" /><br/>
cick on create gpo<br/>
<img src="image 13.png" /><br/>
do this then <br/>
in this course we disbale the antivirus coz thats a very long process <br/>
and it changes every few months<br/>
right cick on Disable Windows Defender <br/>
and ckick edit <br/>
<img src="image 14.png" /><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;<img src="image 15.png" /><br/>
<br/>
thus defender off<br/>
and once we join oir pc's tp this domain we will have no defender and that s how we wanna attack them <br/>
