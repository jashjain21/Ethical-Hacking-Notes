<title>18.Cross Site Scripting overview</title>
</head><body>Also called as XSS <br/>
there are maily 3 types of it <br/>
1.Reflected:INkect something maliciois u get back a popup it doesnt stay on the server<br/>
2.Stored o persistent XXS:Opposite of 1 its stored on the server even if we leave and come back<br/>
3.DOM XSS:when u explout dom its client side.<br/>
<br/>
lets say a file called as <br/>
index.php<br/>
<br/>
&lt;?php<br/>
$username= $ GET['username']<br/>
echo "Hi $username!";<br/>
?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
and u call index.php?username="JAsh"<br/>
o/p will be Hi Jash!<br/>
<br/>
bt what iif we had index.php?username=&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;this will run js as we declare &nbsp;dwe are using script tags and would display an alert on the web pafe and would say 1 :this is reflected xss<br/>
<br/>
blog post mai lets say comment mai u leave something like this so whenever anyone comes on the site this is issued<br/>
as its stored on the server side<br/>
<br/>
reflected and dom require social engineering that is someda has to oepn that malicuos link and then we can point something to us<br/>
<br/>
if its in stored we dont have to do anything we can just steal the cookie with that<br/>
keylogging dos can also be done<br/>
