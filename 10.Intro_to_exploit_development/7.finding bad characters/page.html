<title>7.Finding Bad Characters</title>
</head><body>We need to knwo while generating shellcode which characters are good for the shellcode and which are bad ones <br/>
we could do this by running all the hex characters through our profram and then get to know whhic of them act up<br/>
the null byte(x00) by default acts up<br/>
<br/>

went to this site <br/>

<br/>
thuis removed the first bad character x00 as we know it is by defualt <br/>
so what we do is run each single character throuigh the our program <br/>
lets say x70 runs some command and tells it do to something so we dont want to use it in shellcode otherwise it will break it so basically u look thruugh the program <br/>

<br/>
in this we look for bad character sbasically out of line characters like after 17 if 19 is there so its a priblem ie 18 is bad character like after 17 it coukd be B0 or B1 waisa kuch odd character<br/>
bt here in this example in vulnserver there arent any bad characters yet <br/>
<br/>
so while genrating shellcode we need to remeber al the bad characters<br/>
<br/>
SO HERE ALL WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT IS THE INITAIL X00 FROM OUR CODE OR ELSE IT WOULD START FROM X00 this above pic<br/>
