<title>overwriting the eip</title>
</head><body>EIP itself starts from 2003 bytes and its 4 bytes long <br/>
<img src="image.png" /><br/>
<br/>
its as of now just consisiting of A's and B's in shellcode <br/>
it will get malicious in some time <br/>
after 2003 A's eip starts <br/>
so byte 2004 then is the eip which we are overwriting with B's so that we get to know the difference therwise it would be just a bunch of A's only<br/>
coz A is denoted by 41 <br/>
B is denoted by 42<br/>
so we should get 42424242<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
<br/>
so see ebp its 41414141<br/>
and then eip is 42424242 whihc was the bunch of B's that we had just passed na <br/>
so now it means that we can now control the EIP's<br/>
so now its kinda easy the next steps and all<br/>
