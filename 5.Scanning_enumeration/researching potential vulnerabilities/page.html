we did get access tp ipc na bt we didnt get access to admin though<br/>

lets say u re working where no internet access so try using the terminal now <br/>
use searchsplot bt dont be too specific or else wont get results<br/>
(though in update kali linux we did get results even after being secific)<br/>
