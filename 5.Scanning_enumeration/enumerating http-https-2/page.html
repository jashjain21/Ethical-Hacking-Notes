<title>Enumerating HTTP/HTTPS-2</title>
</head><body>now we ll do directory busting 3 tools prebuilt hai <br/>
dirbuster <br/>
dirb<br/>
gobuster<br/>
<br/>
we used dirbuster<br/>
<img src="image.png" width="600" height="405" /><br/>
in browse go in /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/small list click kar<br/>
file extension depends on the server here its apache which uses php <br/>
could have also written php,txt,docx,pdf,rar etc and so on bt that wou;d increase the time taken to search for it <br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
if small doest work then use medium<br/>
and if that nt enough on interweb there is a large text file also <br/>
these wordlists have 100 s of thousands of well kniown directories<br/>
eg admin,cgi-bin,etc<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 3.png" width="364" height="250" /><br/>
aisa scan hoga<br/>
<br/>
meanwhile start burpsuite<br/>
<br/>
also view source code of our website &nbsp;try to find commments and all <br/>
<img src="image 4.png" width="437" height="300" /><br/>
in here u can find passwords,keys,user private information and other stuff like this <br/>
<br/>
opened burpsuite:<br/>
in proxy tab u get foll:<br/>
<img src="image 5.png" width="700" height="289" /><br/>
right click and say send ti repeater<br/>
repeater shows u ur repsonse in real time<br/>
&nbsp;<img src="image 6.png" width="651" height="300" /><br/>
<br/>
so went in target and there it was :<br/>
<img src="image 7.png" width="600" height="255" /><br/>
<br/>
so copy http://192.168.50.29<br/>
and in target go to scope-add scope-paste it there<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 8.png" width="491" height="250" /><br/>
this limits to searching for only in scope items<br/>
<br/>
in response tab of this <br/>
<img src="image 9.png" /><br/>
we are getting apache versions and all which we got previously by nikto too na <br/>
so this is also info disclosure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
now back to dirbuster<br/>
<img src="image 10.png" /><br/>
in response code:<br/>
200's:okay<br/>
400's:theres some sort of error<br/>
300's:redirect<br/>
500's:server error<br/>
<br/>
now looking at files recieved <br/>
usage file seems interesting <br/>
open its first file in web page bt proxy of burpsuite mai intercept off karna <br/>
<img src="image 11.png" /><br/>
u can get info from here <br/>
Generated by Webalizer Version 2.01-http://192.168.50.129/usage/<br/>
this copy kar in note<br/>
<br/>
bt still not much information disclosed yet na <br/>
now looking at mrtg<br/>
<img src="image 12.png" /><br/>
<br/>
we got this <br/>
<img src="image 13.png" width="552" height="250" /><br/>
this could ve beenn a rabbit hole coz this drectory mrtg had files like webserver.html and log files too<br/>
bt on viewing those two pages too itna diffference nahi mila <br/>
like foll is the webserver.html<br/>
<img src="image 14.png" width="361" height="350" /><br/>
in part 1 e had talked abt poor hygine that they if had a web server wouldbnt have displayed a test page like that bt we got a web server page !<br/>
<br/>
These were some of the enumerations ke methods which we applied <br/>
(u might have a different methodology too and other tools too)<br/>
<br/>
so in nutshell:u need to get the service version info which we have in our notes,backend directories,source code,potential vulnerability scanning with nikto<br/>
and any info u can diverge <br/>
u could even get all this with wappalyser<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
