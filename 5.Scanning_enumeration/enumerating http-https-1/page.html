<title>Enumerating HTTP/HTTPS-1</title>
</head><body>we had ports <br/>
22<br/>
80<br/>
443<br/>
139<br/>
11<br/>
32768<br/>
so we need to think abt point of attack <br/>
sir feels ports 80 and 443 and 139 and sometimes 445 also <br/>
coz these are commonly found with exploits <br/>
in 2017 wannacry virus was there it utilised a flaw in smb and also websites have flwed<br/>
<br/>
port 22 was ssh which isnt so prone to flaws<br/>
remote code executuon is not usually there on ssh<br/>
(means running exploit and getting shell back)<br/>
<br/>
not common to attack ssh <br/>
it isnt juicy kinda <br/>
<br/>
so lets go for 80 and 443<br/>
<br/>
we ll go for the website means search its ip address online<br/>
<img src="image.png" width="958" height="450" /><br/>
in network penetration or web penetration test &nbsp;<br/>
if we such an automatic page then it is an automatic finding<br/>
it isnt exploitable <br/>
Here we got to know its running apache and red hat linux<br/>
so if a client has a default web page like this we would wanna know ki is there a directory associated <br/>
<br/>
it could be they arent hostng something and just put their default page on this site <br/>
<br/>
So this is poor hygiene<br/>
<br/>
when we clicked on the documentation link<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" width="700" height="328" /><br/>
they should have given a page like error 404 not found bt they disclosed this info <br/>
&nbsp;Apache/1.3.20 Server at 127.0.0.1 Port 443<br/>
<br/>
now we ll do web vulnerability scannner <br/>
using nikto <br/>
if like website has good security it will automatically block your nikto<br/>
(bt thats not common)<br/>
<img src="image 3.png" /><br/>
so trying http instead<br/>
<img src="image 4.png" /><br/>
these were the findings to be written in a report <br/>
<br/>
the remote vulnerabilities are the ones whuch we can attack na <br/>
<img src="image 5.png" width="900" height="79" /><br/>
like the ones above<br/>
<br/>
also this below<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
trace is potenitially vulnerable which could lead to cross &nbsp;site scripting (its just info for us now coz havent studied it yet na)<br/>
saving all info to a folder named kioptrix<br/>
