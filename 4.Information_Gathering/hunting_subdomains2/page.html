<title>hunting_subdomains2</title>
</head><body>there are better tools than sublist3er which would give us everything in one go<br/>
https://github.com/OWASP/Amass<br/>
this tool mentioned takes time to run bt is more efficient for big bounty programms<br/>
<br/>
if for the bug bounty we would have just used tesla.com then we would have missed those 161 domains too na <br/>
note :list of reusults in sublist3r not all of the sites given by it will always necessarily work<br/>
<br/>
in sublist3r use -t 100 for 100 threads as compared to 1 thread for faster processing and -v for real time results on the go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
below tool:<br/>
https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe<br/>
this when given a list of websites will probe into them and tell u which of the websites are actuallly alive<br/>
