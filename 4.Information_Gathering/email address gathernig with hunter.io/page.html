</head><body>lookup items of users on internet<br/>
use hunter.io<br/>
<br/>
we are doing tasks like password spraying and credential stuffing<br/>
say we have a loginf form and if we know the format of the email address we send a bunch of valid email addresses as a username and then we could do something as password spraying where we<br/>
take just commonly used passwords eg if its nov2019 then we could say fall2019 exclamation point fire that with every single emial address. and hopefully one sticks thats pasword spraying.<br/>
