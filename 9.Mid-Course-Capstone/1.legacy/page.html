In nmap noramlly we just sscan for tcp side <br/>
bt in real life plpaces do also scan for udp by using -sU<br/>
bt for scanning all udp ports takes a hell lot of time<br/>

Its written message signing disabled which is dangerous !!<br/>
even if u had got message signing as enabled that would have been equally dangerous<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 15pt"><div style="text-align: left">Nmap is letting you know that:<br/>
</div></span></span><ul><li>SMB signing is disabled;</li>
<li>This is the more dangerous — or less secure — option (as opposed to having SMB signing enabled);</li>
<li>This is the default setting for the system you are scanning.</li>
</ul>

Thus smb client did not work<br/>
instead of metasploit could also try with "enum4linux"<br/>

<br/>
Used msfconsole to attck smb coz smb is quite vulnerable(wannacry explout had happened)--first getting smb 's version<br/>

Shell khula and we get the hgihest authprity here as we got authority system<br/>
<br/>
Also meterpreter should match the architecture<br/>
