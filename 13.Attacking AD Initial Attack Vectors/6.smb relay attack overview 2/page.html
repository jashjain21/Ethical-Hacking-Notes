<title>6.Smb relay attack overview</title>
</head><body><img src="image.png" /><br/>
<br/>
smb signing is a packet level protocol <br/>
so if its enabled sp when u try to relay credentials its gonna say hey u arne treallyl that person this packets not signed by u so u wont be able to come in<br/>
if its disabled so it doesnt check the authenticity<br/>
<br/>
eg frank castle is admin on both machines so take his hash fdrom one machine and relay it to the other cant relay it back to the same machine <br/>
<br/>
so in responder.conf turn of smb and http so that we are listneing and not respinding <br/>
and then boot up responder <br/>

now configure ntlmrelayx<br/>
<br/>
it takes the relay passes it to a target file that u specify sm2support so that can incorporate anything with smb2<br/>
so after all this u basically get a sam(shadow) file of all the hashes of the local users<br/>
<br/>
befire all his on both windows machines turn on network discovery<br/>
