<title>11.IPv6 attacks</title>
</head><body>Mainly we ll talk abt dns takeovers via ipv6<br/>
its another form of relaying bt its more reliable<br/>
<br/>
ususally networks on a computer use only ipv4 eg for windows <br/>
ipv6 is also turned on bt whos doing dns for it ??<br/>
actually its nobody<br/>
so we can set up an attakcer machine and listen to all &nbsp;messages that come through attakcer will say i m dns<br/>
so give all ipv6 traffic to me and i ll pass it for u <br/>
<br/>
so we can get access to domain controller via ldap or via smb <br/>
so that machine jiska ipv6 we are using doesnt have to be administrator <br/>
<br/>
using this we can also create another machine loke a blog or somethingh <br/>
we can wait for someone tp login to the netwokr and that comes us to us in ntlm <br/>
and we ldap relay them to domain controller and it creates an acc for us <br/>
<br/>
we ll use mitm6 and combine that to ntlmrelayx<br/>
<br/>
this is also very hard to attack<br/>
