channces are this tool can get caught up on the machine so there are even other tools like Invoke-Mimikatz which is a powerhsell tool so u can upload it to ur windows machine <br/>
or u can run it via iex which is way to download files via powershell and u can download and execute without even touchign the disc<br/>

doing this<br/>

so this gives us ntlm hash of any user which has logged in since the last reboot<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
thus administrator is the onlu account whihc i have logged in into<br/>
here wdigest is imp and was there in windows 7 and befre and stored password in clear text<br/>
so even now in latest windows feature is just off and we can turn it on<br/>
and wait for somebody to logon to the computer <br/>
and we ll find the password then<br/>

thus &nbsp;these both didnt work out<br/>

/patch is imp very much<br/>
lsa means local security authority<br/>
its protected subsystme in windows <br/>
take all such ntlm hashes and crack them and give client a percent of how manty were u able to crack <br/>
u need the above krbtgt ka ntlm for next attack <br/>
