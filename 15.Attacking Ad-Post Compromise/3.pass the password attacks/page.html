<title>3.Pass the password attacks</title>

thus it works successfully<br/>
it tried intitallly on HYDRA-DC bt it didnt work out which means we dont have smb access on that machine<br/>
bt we won on PUNISHER2<br/>
<br/>
so now we can psexec on 139 wala machine too<br/>

tried dumping the sam hashes and to our surprise it did work out successfullu<br/>
<br/>
another alternative for it was secretdump.py ko use karo<br/>
<img src="image 3.png" /><br/>
thus we can now try to dump some hashes and thus also try t get a shell on the machine <br/>
via a meterpreter or even psexec<br/>
<br/>
On local accounts u could try password spraying as there isnt any policy of u being locked out there <br/>
Bt dont try the same thing on domain accounts<br/>
<br/>
now we ll learn how to dump hashes when we have these user accounts and then would crack and thus pass them<br/>
